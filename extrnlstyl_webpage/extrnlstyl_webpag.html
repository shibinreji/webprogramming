CSS selectors are used to select the HTML elements you want to style.We can divide CSS selectors into five categories:
Simple selectors(select elements based on name,id,class),Combinator selectors(select elments based on a relationship between them),Psuedo-elements selectors(select and style a part of  an element),Attribute selectors(select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)
<br>
<p>The id selector uses the id attribute of an HTML element to select a specific element.The id of an element is unique within a page,so the id selector is used to select one unique element!
To select an element with a specific id,write a hash(#) character,followed by the id of the element</p>

<div class="center">The class selector selects HTML elements with a specific class attribute.To select elements with a specific class,write a period(.) character,folllowed by the class name.You can also specify that only specific HTML elements should be affected by a class.</div>
